## FCCUmpire: Privacy policy

Welcome to the FCCUmpire app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Anas Alam. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on our database only, and can be used by the user to retrieve data or regain access to their account by which user can view their result and also take a retest without loosing their previous data.

### Explanation of data needed in the app

The list of information required by the app to continue using the app is listed below:

<br/>

| Information | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| First Name | This is required to generate a certifcate unique to the user where his first name will be mentioned. |
| Last Name | This is required to generate a certifcate unique to the user where his last name will be mentioned. |
| Email Address | This is required to check and allow access to user previous data and also to send them their generated certificate over to the mail. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
